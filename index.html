          <h2>Unemployment Rate <div> by Country (2019)</h2>
          <p>
            Unemployment is obviously one of the <span class="highlight">world's most serious problems</span>; certain regions have very low unemployment rates, 
            while others have very high rates, but the truth is that people all around the world are struggling 
            with this issue. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The global unemployment rate for <span class="highlight dark-text">2019</span> was <span class="highlight light-text">7.11%</span>, a 0.17% decline from 2018. The map displayed here shows how the 
            Unemployment rate varies by country. The shade of the country corresponds to the magnitude of the indicator. 
            The darker the shade, the higher the value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the fact that many governments are taking significant steps to address the issue, the problem 
            continues to persist around the world. There are a <span class="highlight">number of reasons for unemployment</span>. These include
            recessions, depressions, technological improvements, job outsourcing, and voluntarily leaving one job to find another.
          </p>

          <h2>Unemployment Rate <div> by Region (2019)</h2>
          <p>
            The unemployment rate is undoubtedly an important indicator of economic and social well-being. 
            Here, to explore more on the regional unemployment rate in the year of 2019, we <span class="highlight">breakdown by region</span>
            and show that large international differences hide even larger differences among regions within each country. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the chart, the <span class="highlight dark-text">Africa</span> region ranks the <span class="highlight dark-text">highest</span> in unemployment rate, which is total of <span class="highlight light-text">9.26%</span> in terms of the unemployment rate;
            while the Caribbean region ranks the second highest in unemployment rate, which is total of 9.20%. This is followed by South America, Europe, 
            Central America, and Oceania. Lastly, Asia has the second lowest unemployment rate, while North 
            <span class="highlight dark-text">America</span> has the <span class="highlight dark-text">lowest</span> unemployment rate by region, which is a total of <span class="highlight light-text">4.27%</span> unemployment rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Africa region has been suffer in the issue of unemployment for years, and the causes of current high youth unemployment 
            include inadequate skills, lack of experience, and a mismatch between education and training and requisite job skills. 
            Other factors include <span class="highlight">economies' low growth</span> and <span class="highlight">job creation's slow pace</span>. Furthermore, Nigeria and Ethiopia had the highest number 
            of people employed in Africa. Their working population amounted to around 60 million and 56 million respectively, which is a scary amount of
            number.
          </p>
          <p>
            This concludes the regional unemployment rate in 2019.

          <h2>Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment (2019)</h2>
          <p>
            According to the principle established by <span class="highlight">Okun's Law</span> (Okun, 1962), there is a corresponding two 
            percent increase in employment for every established one percent increase in GDP. The principle 
            states that GDP levels are driven by the principles of demand and supply, and as such, an increase 
            in demand leads to an increase in GDP. Such an increase in demand must be accompanied by a corresponding 
            increase in productivity and employment to keep up with the demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that, we will now explore more on the <span class="highlight">relationship between GDP and Unemployment Rate</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            GDP and unemployment rates are linked in the sense that both are <span class="highlight">macroeconomic factors</span> that are used to 
            gauge the state of an economy. (Esther, 2022) A rise in the GDP is significant in the study of macroeconomic 
            trends in a nation. This is also true of a rise or decrease in unemployment levels. GDP and unemployment 
            rates usually go together because a decrease in the GDP is reflected in a decrease in the rate of employment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This sums up the relationship between GDP per Capita and Unemployment Rate of a country.

          <h2>The Rise of Covid-19 Event</h2>
          <p>
            Unemployment Rate in the world <span class="highlight">averaged 7.91% from 2011 until 2021</span>, reaching an all time high of 8.31 
            percent in the year of 2020 and a record low of 7.11 percent in the year of 2019.

          <p>
            This graph addresses some questions about the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the unemployment rate. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As we can see, the unemployment rate jumped in <span class="highlight dark-text">2020</span> at <span class="highlight light-text">8.31%</span>, 
            to a rate <span class="highlight">not seen since 2011</span> and in <span class="highlight dark-text">2021</span> stood at <span class="highlight light-text">8.29%</span>, compared with only 0.02 percent in 2020. Caused by the Covid-19, the unemployment rate has 
            reached a peak in the year of 2020 at 8.31% worldwide - Most people were unable to work because their employer 
            lost or closed their businesses due to the pandemic. It was an <span class="highlight">unprecedented joblessness amount</span> since employment 
            data collection started in 1948.

            This concludes the effect of the Rise of Covid-19 on Unemployment Rate.

          <h2>Before & During/After <div> Covid-19 Event</h2>
          <p>
            Let us investigate further on the unemployment rate of 20 countries before and during/after Covid-19 pandemic. 
            These 20 countries rank in the first 20 places in unemployment rate. Caused by the Covid-19, all of the countries

            Covid-19</span> pandemic was only <span class="highlight light-text">17.97%</span> in total, however, <span class="highlight dark-text">during or
